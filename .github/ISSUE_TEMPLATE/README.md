# Issues Templates

## About

In defining the potential templates for incoming issues, it must be accepted that the issuer is the target for these templates. This is to comply with the perspective approach to this repo, and allow individuals from non-technical experts (I) to [Ontology Developers](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/getting_started/#ontology-engineerdeveloper-you-are) (IV) to create new issues with ease, as they are the roles dealing directly with terms and their contexts.

## Practice

The perspective, in this repo, relies on each template's 'name' and 'about' content, while the possible 'title', 'tag', and 'assignees' are catered to the Ontology Curator's benefit.
